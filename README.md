> The GreyCat escaped the quantum box by evaluating all many-worlds alternatives...now let's see how he can help you to do the same with your data and business critical analytics!

#### What is GreyCat?

GreyCat is the first Temporal Many-World Graph.
In a nutshell, this project defines a graph storage and processing framework that allows to store complex data structures, which are highly connected, and rapidly evolving over time.
Finally, this data structure can be seen has infinitely cloneable to evaluate all potential alternatives modifications to find the best one.
To sum up GreyCat is the core data structure to build business live reasoning engine handling data in motion.  

#### What is a temporal graph?

Graphs allow to organize and structure data in the form of a set of nodes and relationships between these nodes. Data in real-life applications is barely static, think of social network graphs, i.e., graphs evolve and change over time. MWG adds time as a first-class entity to the graph. Therefore, all nodes, attributes and relationships can change over time.

#### To do what?

In short, analyzing data in motion! In many domains data coming from different devices and from various time points, has to be aggregated in a coherent view in order to reason and take decisions. Towards such goal MWG includes various machine learning algorithms. Example applications where GreyCat is useful for: IoT systems, cyber-physical systems like smart Grid, trading prediction, and simulation engines.

#### Who are we?

Behind GreyCat stands a research group working hard to make real-time analytics of complex systems a reality. GreyCat is developed in Java, with lots of attention to performance and memory requirements. It us proudly built from scratch without any dependency and can process millions of nodes per second on a single computer.

#### How to start?

In this small documentation we provide the essential information for a quick start. Then, we provide links to  a case demonstrating the efficiency and usefulness of GreyCat.
