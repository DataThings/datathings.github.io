Hello world, from **DataThings**.

We are a startup of four passionate researchers holding PhDs in Computer Science.
After several years of successful collaboration at the University of Luxembourg/SnT, we founded DataThings to start the next chapter in live data analytics.
We aim at improving live analytics over complex and time-evolving data a reality in order to support your businesses in operational decision-making.
This blog will be kind of our diary on experiments and results we find through our adventure.
