# Quick start

GreyCat is distributed over maven repository.
Therefore it can be used with maven, ivy, sbt...
Simply add the api and core module dependency to your project and start using GreyCat api such as:

``` xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.datathings</groupId>
	<artifactId>greycat</artifactId>
	<version>${greycat.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

If you prefer to code in JavaScript or TypeScript we also distribute GreyCat over NPM central repository.
Into your NPM project just use the following:

``` sh
npm -i greycat --save
```

Next go for the next session for your first graph.
