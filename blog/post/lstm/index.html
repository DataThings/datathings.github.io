<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory">LSTM Neural Networks</a>, which stand for <strong>L</strong>ong <strong>S</strong>hort-<strong>T</strong>erm <strong>M</strong>emory, are a particular type of recurrent neural networks that got lot of attention the last few years within the machine learning community.</p>

<p>In a simple way, LSTM networks have some internal <strong>contextual state cells</strong> that act as long-term or short-term memory cells.
The output of the LSTM network is <strong>modulated</strong> by the state of these memory cells. This is a very important property when we want the prediction of the neural network to depend on the <strong>historical context</strong> of inputs, rather than only on the last input.</p>

<p>As a simple example, consider that we want to predict the next number of the following sequence:  6 -&gt; 7 -&gt; 8 -&gt; ?. We would like to have the prediction to be <strong>9</strong>. However, if we provide this sequence: 2 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 8 -&gt; ?, we would like to get the prediction of <strong>16</strong>.
Although in both cases, the current last input was number <strong>8</strong>, the prediction outcome should be different (because we want take into account the contextual information of previous values and not only the last one).</p>

<p>LSTM networks manage to achieve this goal by integrating a <strong>loop</strong> that allows information to be passed from one step of the network to the next. These loops make recurrent neural networks seem magical. But if we think about it for a second, as you read this post, you understand each word based on your understanding of the previous words. You don’t throw everything away and start thinking from scratch again at each word.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the more time passes, the less likely it becomes that the next event depends on a very old one. This time dependency distance itself is as well a contextual information. LSTM networks achieve this by <strong>learning when to remember and learning when to forget</strong>, through their forget gate weights.</p>

<p>In this post, I won&rsquo;t go through the technical details of how LSTM are implemented. <a href="http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/">This blog post</a> explains very nicely the rational behind them. Instead I will show the different applications usages.</p>

<h2 id="text-generation">Text Generation</h2>

<p>Generating a text, like this one, can be seen as an LSTM task where each letter is generated taking into account all the previously generated letters. <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">Andrej Karpathy,</a> shows different examples of text generation by LSTM depending on the training set. These are some of the automatically generated texts. Notice how it learns the structures</p>

Breaking and strongly should be buried, when I perish

Good everybody. Thank you very much. God bless the United States of America, and has already began with the world’s gathering their health insurance. 
It’s about hard-earned for our efforts that are not continued.
We are all the assumptionion to the streets of the Americas that we are still for everybody and destruction. 
We are doing a lot of this. 
I know that someone would be prefered to their children to take a million insurance company. We’re watching their people and continued to find ourselves with Republicans — to give up on these challenges and despite the challenges of our country. In the last two years, we must recognise that our borders have access from the world. We’re continuing that this day of things that the United States will clean up it´s allies and prosperity to stand up enough to be a sanctions that we made their faith, and for the country of the Internet to Osama bin Laden.
Thank you. God bless you. Good morning, everybody. And May God loss man. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, everybody.

<h2 id="handwriting-recognition">Handwriting recognition</h2>

<p>This is animation from Alex Graves, showing an LSTM network performing in live:</p>

  <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/mLxsbWAYIpw" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></iframe>

<ul>
<li>Row 1: Shows the letters that are recognised (outputs of the network)</li>
<li>Row 2: Shows the states of the memory cells (Notice how they reset when a character is recognised)</li>
<li>Row 3: Shows the writing as it&rsquo;s being analyzed by the LSTM (inputs of the network)</li>
<li>Row 4: Shows the gradient backpropagated to the inputs from the most active characters. This reflects the <strong>forget</strong> effect.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="handwriting-generation">Handwriting generation</h2>

<p>As an inverted experiment, here are some handwriting generated by LSTM.</p>

<h2 id="music-generation">Music generation</h2>

<p>Since music, just like text, is a sequence of notes (instead of characters), it can be generated by LSTM as well by taking into account the previously played notes. <a href="http://www.hexahedria.com/2015/08/03/composing-music-with-recurrent-neural-networks/">Here</a> you can find an interesting explanation of how to train LSTM on midi files. Otherwise, you can enjoy the following generated music:</p>

</audio></p>

<p><audio controls="">
    <source src="./nnet_music_3.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
</audio></p>

<p><audio controls="">
    <source src="./nnet_music_9.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
</audio></p>

<h2 id="language-translation">Language Translation</h2>

<p>Language translation can be seen as a <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/seq2seq">sequence-to-sequence</a> mapping. A group of researchers, in collaboration with NVidia published details on how to tame LSTM for such task (<a href="https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/introduction-neural-machine-translation-with-gpus/">part1</a>, <a href="https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/introduction-neural-machine-translation-gpus-part-2/">part2</a>, <a href="https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/introduction-neural-machine-translation-gpus-part-3/">part 3</a>).
In a nutshell, they created a neural net with an encoder to compress the text to a higher abstract vectorial representation and a decoder to decode to the target language.</p>

<h2 id="image-captioning">Image captioning</h2>

<p>Finally, the most impressive and magical use of LSTM networks is to generate from an input image, a text caption describing the contents of the image. Microsoft research is progressing a lot in this area. Here are some sample demos of their results:

<img src="./microsoft1.png" alt="" /></p>
